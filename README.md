Kēmu Kupu.

Our Kēmu Kupu application is an educational application aimed to help users learn to spell te reo Māori words. This program will quiz users through speech synthesis, saying the Māori word and having the user type in the answer. 

Our program uses java, FXML and css files. Java files were used for the implementation of features while FXML and css files were used to implement the user interface of the program. 


To run the program:

Fist change into the directory
...
>cd assignement-3-and-project-team-07
...

To run this file, first change the permissions on the executable script file
...
> chmod +x Run_KemuKupu.sh
...

Now execute the script
...
> ./Run_KemuKupu.sh
...

To implement macrons in the textfield, type ~ or ` before the vowel you wish to make a macron. This information is also provided inside of the program that can be accessed via the macron help button.
